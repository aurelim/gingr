Gingr is normally distributed as a dependency-free Linux binary or OS X app.
This source distribution is intended for other operating systems or for
development.


Dependencies:
-------------
   - Qt4 >= 4.8 ( http://qt-project.org/downloads )
   - Harvest tools ( https://github.com/marbl/harvest-tools )
      - Protocol Buffers ( https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ )
      - Zlib ( http://www.zlib.net/ )
   - XCode ( OS X only, https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ )


Setup:
------
   ./configure [--with-harvest=...] [--with-protobuf=...]
   qmake

Notes: The --with-harvest and --with-protobuf options specify the top-level
directory of their respective installations, eg. without "/bin" or "/lib", and
default to /usr/local.


Building (Linux):
-----------------

Build:
   make

Product:
   gingr (executable)

Deployment:
   gingr relies on Qt libraries, which can be included statically during
Setup by calling qmake from a static Qt installation (which must be in a
separate location from any dynamic Qt installations to avoid library
ambiguities).


Building (OS X):
----------------

Build:
   [Open gingr.xcodeproj in XCode and build]

Product:
   gingr.app (location depends on XCode settings)

Deployment:
   'macdeployqt gingr.app' will bundle Qt frameworks in the App.
