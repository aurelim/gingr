Gingr is a flexible platform for visualizing and compressing alignments and
phylogenetic trees. It is part of the Harvest suite and was designed to work
with Parsnp, a scalable genome alignment tool (see
[Harvest](https://github.com/marbl/harvest)).

Gingr is primarily distributed as a binary for Linux or app for OS X
(see Harvest link above). However, the source is
provided here for other build environments or for development.
